# Project-1

**Korean Baseball Analysis** 
This is anotebook playing around with matplotlib and seaborn as well as using an object oriented class system so that the user can observe any correlation between team and stat

**Kaggle Tabular Playground** 
A competition i entered on kaggle to predict sales using a basic XGBoost model just to understand how it works 
How to improve: 
* Use gradient boosting to improve XGBoost parameters
* Add a way of measuring how accurate the model is (could'nt get MSE to work for some reason - will look at later)

**Corona predict comp** 
Another competition I entered on kaggle to test out the AutoML module in python which worked extremely well and placed me quite highly in the leaderboards even though it virtually no skills to use
